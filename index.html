        <p class="title1"><b>The king</b></p>
          <p class="contenido1">
            A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or
            diagonally) unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece or
            the move would place the king in check.

      <div class="caja2">
        <p class="title2"><b>The queen</b></p>
          <p class="contenido2">
          The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line
          vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the
          rook and bishop.
        </p>

      <div class="caja3">
        <p class="title3"><b>The bishop</b></p>
        <p class="contenido3">
          The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin on,
          i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a consequence of its
          diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or black
          squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as light- squared or
          dark-squared bishops.

      <div class="caja4">
        <p class="title4"><b>The knight</b></p>
        <p class="contenido4">
          The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square that
          is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares
          vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks
          like the letter "L". Unlike all other standard chess pieces, the knight
          can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination
          square.
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="caja5">
          <p class="title5"><b>The rook</b></p>
          <p class="contenido5">
            The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of
            unoccupied squares (see diagram).
          </p>
        </div>
        
          <div class="caja6">
            <p class="title6"><b>The pawn</b></p>
            <p class="contenido6">
              Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn
              moves by advancing a single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it
              has the option of advancing two squares.
